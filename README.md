# Iris_classification
Here I am using Iris dataset for the species Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica and we need to classify this species of flower by   taking different features of flower like petal and sepal.
# TOOLS USED
PYTHON
•	Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high -level programming language with dynamic semantics.
•	Python V3.9 is the latest.
GOOGLE COLAB
•	Colaboratory or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser like Jupyter notebook, well suited to ML, data analysis etc. 
•	Google colab can be accessed by going to any browser and searching “https://research.google.com/colaboratory/”
•	In Google colab we use libraries like pandas and sklearn
SKLEARN
•	Sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for ML, modelling, classification, regression etc.
PANDAS
•	Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
# ALGORITHM USED
KNN
•	K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised ML algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
DECISION TREE
•	Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. 
CONCLUSION
•	By using KNN I got 96.7% accuracy in my model.
•	By using Decision Tree I got 100% accuracy.
•	I have come to a conclusion that for this dataset Decision Tree is more suitable as it is more accurate.
